# Alterrain Mod for Vintage Story

[Download the latest release](../../releases/latest)

### Warning

As with all terrain generator mods: Do not load your beloved existing worlds with a terrain mod or a changed version of a terrain mod.
Always generate new worlds to try out the terrain mod and deactivate the terrain mod after testing to avoid accidents.

### Limitations

This mod does not work with other terrain mods or mods changing landforms.
It does however work well with extra high worlds which the vanilla generator discourages.

### Missing Features

- No mod config file
- No integration for ruins or story buildings, thus the Homo Sapiens game mode is the only fully playable for now
- Rock strata continue to use the vanilla generator and thus do not match the landscape
- Oceans, beaches and salt water are disabled
- Rivers have no movement or current
- The world generation configuration parameters are ignored:
    - landcover
    - oceanscale
- There are no landforms yet:
    - Vulcanos
    - Dunes
    - Cliffs
