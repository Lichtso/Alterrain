[Download the latest release](../../releases/)

### Warning

As with all terrain generator mods: Do not load your beloved existing worlds with a terrain mod or a changed version of a terrain mod.
Always generate new worlds to try out the terrain mod and deactivate the terrain mod after testing to avoid accidents.

### Limitations

This mod does not work with other terrain mods or mods changing landforms.

### Missing Features

- The world generation configuration parameters are ignored
- Fertility (forest, shrub, flower, etc. density) continues to use the vanilla generator and thus do not match the landscape
- Geological provinces continue to use the vanilla generator and thus do not match the landscape
- Climate and bioms are disabled
- Oceans, beaches and salt water are disabled
- Rivers have no movement or current
